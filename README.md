# Olfaction
Files for the olfaction paper

These are the files used for the implementation of the model for insect olfaction.

Please download all the files to the same folder.

Additionally to the files here contained, two more files are needed: UKF.m and isonemptyfield.m . The two of them can
  be found in the following addresses, respectively: 
    https://github.com/sbitzer/BayesFilters
    https://github.com/sbitzer/Matlab-helpers

The file CSHS.m can be executed on its own, giving it an empty ([]) input. Default values for all the parameters will 
be taken, which can be seen in the ouput structure 'par'.

To see examples of simulations, run the different Cells in the file Examples.m.
